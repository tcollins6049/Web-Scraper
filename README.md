# Web-Scraper
By: Tyler Collins

### Introduction
This is a web scraper made using Python which scrapes two seperate websites, xymoxdrumco.com and lonestarpercussion.com.
The program loops through the site map for both sites and obtains information such as the product name, price, type, etc. 
It then loads this data into a csv file where it is sorted into catagories and subcatagories. It then creates multiple visualizations
which compare prices and discounts between items.
